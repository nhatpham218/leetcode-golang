# 3003. Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

First, you are allowed to change at most one index in `s` to another lowercase English letter.

After that, do the following partitioning operation until `s` is empty:

- Choose the longest prefix of `s` containing at most `k` distinct characters.
- Delete the prefix from `s` and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in `s` maintain their initial order.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "accca", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[2] to something other than a and c, for example, b. then it becomes "acbca".
Then we perform the operations:
- The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is "ac", we remove it and s becomes "bca".
- Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is "bc", so we remove it and s becomes "a".
- Finally, we remove "a" and s becomes empty, so the procedure ends.
Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aabaab", k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
Initially s contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "xxyz", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[0] or s[1] to something other than characters in s, for example, to change s[0] to w.
Then s becomes "wxyz", which consists of 4 distinct characters, so as k is 1, it will divide into 4 partitions.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 26`

## Solution

### Algorithm Overview

The problem requires maximizing the number of partitions by optionally changing at most one character, then repeatedly taking the longest prefix with at most k distinct characters.

### Key Insights

1. **Partitioning Rule**: Each partition is the longest prefix with at most k distinct characters.
2. **One Change Allowed**: We can change at most one character before partitioning.
3. **Goal**: Maximize the number of partitions.

### Approach

1. Calculate the baseline number of partitions without any changes
2. For each possible position to change, calculate the resulting number of partitions
3. Return the maximum number of partitions found

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: TBD
- **Space Complexity**: TBD

### Implementation

```go
func maxPartitionsAfterOperations(s string, k int) int {
    // Implementation to be added
}
```

### Test Cases

- `s = "accca", k = 2` → `3`
- `s = "aabaab", k = 3` → `1`
- `s = "xxyz", k = 1` → `4`
