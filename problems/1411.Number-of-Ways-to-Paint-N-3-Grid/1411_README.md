# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

## Problem Description

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow**, or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```

## Constraints

- `n == grid.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`

## Topics

- Dynamic Programming

## Hints

1. We will use Dynamic programming approach. we will try all possible configuration.
2. Let dp[idx][prev1col][prev2col][prev3col] be the number of ways to color the rows of the grid from idx to n-1 keeping in mind that the previous row (idx - 1) has colors prev1col, prev2col and prev3col. Build the dp array to get the answer.

## Solution

```go
func numOfWays(n int) int {
    // TODO: Implement solution
}
```
