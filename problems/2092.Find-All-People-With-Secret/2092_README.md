# 2092. Find All People With Secret

## Problem Description

You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]` indicates that person `x_i` and person `y_i` have a meeting at `time_i`. A person may attend **multiple meetings** at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer `firstPerson`.

Person `0` has a **secret** and initially shares the secret with a person `firstPerson` at time `0`. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person `x_i` has the secret at `time_i`, then they will share the secret with person `y_i`, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared **instantaneously**. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return *a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place.* You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,5]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.
At time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.
At time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 know the secret after all the meetings.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`
- `meetings[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= x_i, y_i <= n - 1`
- `x_i != y_i`
- `1 <= time_i <= 10^5`
- `1 <= firstPerson <= n - 1`

## Solution

### Algorithm Overview

This problem can be solved using **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** or **BFS/DFS** approaches. The key insight is to process meetings chronologically and connect people who meet at the same time.

### Approach

1. **Sort meetings by time**: Process meetings in chronological order
2. **Group meetings by time**: Meetings at the same time should be processed together
3. **Union-Find or Graph Traversal**: Connect people who meet and share the secret
4. **Track secret holders**: Maintain a set of people who know the secret

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(m log m + n α(n))
  - Sorting meetings: O(m log m)
  - Union-Find operations: O(m α(n))
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for Union-Find data structure

### Implementation

```go
func findAllPeople(n int, meetings [][]int, firstPerson int) []int {
    // Sort meetings by time
    // Group meetings at the same time
    // Use Union-Find to connect people who meet
    // Return all people connected to person 0
}
```
