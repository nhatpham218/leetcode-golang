# 3349. Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection I

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of n integers and an integer `k`, determine whether there exist two adjacent subarrays of length `k` such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. Specifically, check if there are two subarrays starting at indices `a` and `b` (`a < b`), where:

- Both subarrays `nums[a..a + k - 1]` and `nums[b..b + k - 1]` are strictly increasing.
- The subarrays must be adjacent, meaning `b = a + k`.

Return `true` if it is possible to find two such subarrays, and `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
The subarray starting at index 2 is [7, 8, 9], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 5 is [2, 3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, so the result is true.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7], k = 5
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 < 2 * k <= nums.length`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

### Algorithm Overview

The problem requires finding two adjacent subarrays of length `k` that are both strictly increasing. We need to check all possible pairs of adjacent subarrays.

### Key Insights

1. **Adjacent subarrays**: If the first subarray starts at index `i`, the second must start at index `i + k`.
2. **Strictly increasing**: Each element in a subarray must be greater than the previous element.
3. **Overlap constraint**: The constraint `1 < 2 * k <= nums.length` ensures there's enough space for two non-overlapping subarrays.

### Approach

1. Iterate through all possible starting positions for the first subarray
2. For each position, check if the subarray of length `k` starting there is strictly increasing
3. If it is, check if the adjacent subarray (starting at `i + k`) is also strictly increasing
4. Return `true` if both conditions are met for any pair

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k) where n is the array length and k is the subarray length
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the algorithm itself

### Implementation

```go
func hasIncreasingSubarrays(nums []int, k int) bool {
    // Check all possible adjacent subarray pairs
    // Verify both are strictly increasing
}
```

### Test Cases

- `nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1], k = 3` → `true`
- `nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7], k = 5` → `false`
