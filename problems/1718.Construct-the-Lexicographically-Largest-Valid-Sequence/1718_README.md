# 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, construct a sequence with elements in the range `[1, n]` that satisfies the following rules:

- The integer `1` appears exactly once.
- Every integer `i` between `2` and `n` appears exactly twice.
- For each integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the distance between the two occurrences of `i` is exactly `i`.

Return the **lexicographically largest** valid sequence.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 20`

## Solution

(TODO)
