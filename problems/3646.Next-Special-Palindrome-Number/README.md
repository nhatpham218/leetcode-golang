# 3646. Next Special Palindrome Number

## Problem Description

You are given an integer `n`.

A number is called special if:

- It is a palindrome.
- Every digit `k` in the number appears exactly `k` times.

Return the smallest special number strictly greater than `n`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 22
Explanation:
22 is the smallest special number greater than 2, as it is a palindrome and the digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 33
Output: 212
Explanation:
212 is the smallest special number greater than 33, as it is a palindrome and the digits 1 and 2 appear exactly 1 and 2 times respectively.
```

## Constraints

- 0 <= n <= 10^15

## Solution

The solution function `specialPalindrome(n int64) int64` is provided but left blank for you to implement.

## Approach

To solve this problem, you need to:

1. Find the next number greater than `n` that satisfies both conditions:
   - It is a palindrome
   - Every digit `k` appears exactly `k` times

2. Key observations:
   - A special number can only contain digits 1, 2, and 3 (since digit 4 would require 4 occurrences, making the minimum length 4, but then we'd need other digits to balance the palindrome)
   - For a palindrome with digit frequencies, the structure is constrained
   - We need to systematically generate candidates and check both conditions

3. Strategy:
   - Generate potential palindromes in ascending order
   - For each palindrome, verify if digit frequencies match the digit values
   - Return the first valid palindrome greater than `n`
