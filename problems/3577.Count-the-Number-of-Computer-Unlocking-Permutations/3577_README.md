# 3577. Count the Number of Computer Unlocking Permutations

## Problem Description

You are given an array `complexity` of length `n`.

There are `n` **locked** computers in a room with labels from 0 to `n - 1`, each with its own **unique** password. The password of the computer `i` has a complexity `complexity[i]`.

The password for the computer labeled 0 is **already** decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

- You can decrypt the password for the computer `i` using the password for computer `j`, where `j` is **any** integer less than `i` with a lower complexity. (i.e. `j < i` and `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`)
- To decrypt the password for computer `i`, you must have already unlocked a computer `j` such that `j < i` and `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`.

Find the number of **permutations** of `[0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)]` that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Note** that the password for the computer **with label** 0 is decrypted, and *not* the computer with the first position in the permutation.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: complexity = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The valid permutations are:
- [0, 1, 2]
  - Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
  - Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[1].
  - Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 1 since complexity[1] < complexity[2].
- [0, 2, 1]
  - Unlock computer 0 first with root password.
  - Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[2].
  - Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since complexity[0] < complexity[1].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no possible permutations which can unlock all computers.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= complexity.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= complexity[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

- Ensure that the element at index 0 has the unique minimum complexity (no other element can match its value).
- Fix index 0 as the first in the unlocking order.
- The remaining indices from `1` to `n - 1` can then be arranged arbitrarily, yielding `factorial(n - 1)` possible orders.

## Solution

This problem requires understanding the constraints for unlocking computers and determining valid permutation counts.

### Key Insights

1. Computer 0 must always be unlocked first (it's the root)
2. To unlock computer `i`, there must exist an already-unlocked computer `j` where `j < i` and `complexity[j] < complexity[i]`
3. For a valid solution to exist, computer 0 must have a **unique minimum** complexity value

### Algorithm Overview

The solution involves:
1. Checking if computer 0 has the unique minimum complexity
2. If yes, calculating factorial(n-1) modulo 10^9 + 7
3. If no, returning 0

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for validation + O(n) for factorial calculation = O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Implementation

```go
func countPermutations(complexity []int) int {
    // Check if complexity[0] is unique minimum
    // If yes: return factorial(n-1) % (10^9 + 7)
    // If no: return 0
}
```

## Test Results

Test cases from examples:
- Example 1: complexity = [1,2,3] → Expected: 2
- Example 2: complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4] → Expected: 0
