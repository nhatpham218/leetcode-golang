# 3510. Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array II

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Select the **adjacent** pair with the **minimum** sum in `nums`. If multiple such pairs exist, choose the leftmost one.
- Replace the pair with their sum.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to make the array **non-decreasing**.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element (if it exists).

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The pair (3,1) has the minimum sum of 4. After replacement, nums = [5,2,4].
- The pair (2,4) has the minimum sum of 6. After replacement, nums = [5,6].

The array nums became non-decreasing in two operations.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The array nums is already sorted.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

1. We can perform the simulation using data structures.
2. Maintain an array index and value using a map since we need to find the next and previous ones.
3. Maintain the indices to be removed using a hash set.
4. Maintain the neighbor sums with the smaller indices (set or priority queue).
5. Keep the 3 structures in sync during the removals.
