# 3346. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `numOperations`.

You must perform an operation `numOperations` times on `nums`, where in each operation you:

- Select an index `i` that was not selected in any previous operations.
- Add an integer in the range `[-k, k]` to `nums[i]`.

Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in `nums` after performing the operations.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:
- Adding 0 to nums[1]. nums becomes [1, 4, 5].
- Adding -1 to nums[2]. nums becomes [1, 4, 4].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:
- Adding 0 to nums[1].
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`
- `0 <= numOperations <= nums.length`

## Solution

### Algorithm Overview

The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any element after performing at most `numOperations` operations, where each operation can add a value in the range `[-k, k]` to an element.

### Key Insights

1. **Target Value**: For each possible target value, calculate how many elements can be transformed to that target.
2. **Range**: An element `nums[i]` can be transformed to any value in the range `[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]`.
3. **Operations**: We can perform at most `numOperations` operations to transform elements.

### Approach

TBD

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: TBD
- **Space Complexity**: TBD

### Implementation

```go
func maxFrequency(nums []int, k int, numOperations int) int {
    // Implementation to be added
}
```

### Test Cases

- `nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2` → `2`
- `nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1` → `2`
